# Welcome to the Pathfinding Visualizer!

This is a React project designed to help you understand some of the most fundamental pathfinding algorithms. Dive in to visualize how algorithms like DFS, BFS, A* Search, and Dijkstra find the shortest path and traverse through a maze.




## Algorithms

### Dijkstra:

Dijkstra's algorithm is a weighted,uninformed search algorithm. It methodically explores all possible routes, ensuring that it always discovers the most optimal path based on given weights. This optimal solution accounts for factors like distance and time. Its principles are akin to those used in navigation software to determine the shortest route between two points, considering variables such as speed limits and traffic conditions.

### A* Search (Manhattan):

This is a weighted informed search algorithm. A* leverages the location of the destination node to guide its search towards the correct direction. It consistently ensures the most efficient path and is usually faster, requiring less exploration time compared to Dijkstra's algorithm. The Manhattan heuristic computes the distance between the current node and the destination by summing up the vertical and horizontal distances in a straightforward manner.

### Depth First Search:

This algorithm operates as an unweighted, uninformed search method. Depth-first search delves deep into one branch, exploring all its sub-branches, before moving on to the next primary branch. Its behavior becomes particularly evident when visualized with a maze; you'll observe it traversing every possible pathway until it encounters the destination node. It cannot always guarantee the most efficient path unless navigating a maze with a singular route. Occasionally, depth-first search might yield a swift and accurate solution, but such outcomes are largely dependent on chance.

### Breadth First Search:

BFS is an unweighted, uninformed search strategy that works by systematically exploring all nodes at the present depth level before advancing to nodes at the succeeding depth. In the context of a maze, BFS will inspect all immediate neighbors before progressing further into the maze's branches. This ensures that the shortest path is always discovered if one exists. However, BFS explores a vast number of nodes, especially in larger graphs or mazes, which can make it less efficient in terms of time and space compared to some heuristics-based methods.
